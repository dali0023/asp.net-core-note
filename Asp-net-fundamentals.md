**View Components**
    - Pass data to views using several ways:
        - Strongly typed data: **ViewModel**
        - Weakly typed data: **ViewData**, **ViewBag**

**Middleware:**
 - What is middleware
 - How middleware works
 - Where is middleware available in our apps
 - How to add a new middleware
 - Order of middleware
 - `Use()`, `Next()`, `Map()` Method

**Middleware Order**

![Middleware Order](middleware.png)

**Configure method of Startup.cs**
```c#
// set a basic middleware for all requests as did not mention a specific
app.Run(async (HttpContext context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Welcome to middlewre vai");
});

// To start the application
app.Run();
```

**Middleware Chain/ Multiple Middleware:** run middleware one after other

![Middleware Chain](middleware-chain.png)

```c#
// For Multiple Middleware
// Middleware 1
app.Use(async (HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Middleware-1  ");
    await next(context);
});

// MIddleware 2
// writing Type of (HttpContext, RequestDelegate) are optional.
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Middleware-2  ");
    await next(context); // next() called next middleware and without it middleware will not go to next one.
});

// Last Middleware
app.Run(async (HttpContext context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync(" Last-Middleware");
});

app.Run();
```




**Built-in middleware**

- **Authentication Middleware:** This provides authentication functionality for the application, such as handling login and logout functionality.
- **Static Files Middleware:** This serves static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, to the client.
- **Routing Middleware:** This maps incoming requests to the appropriate action in a controller.
- **Session Middleware:** This provides a way to store user-specific data between requests, such as user preferences or shopping cart contents.
- **Error/Exception Handling Middleware:** This provides a way to handle exceptions that occur during request processing and produce a friendly error response.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Middleware:** This provides a way to handle cross-domain requests by allowing or denying specific origins.
- **GZIP Compression Middleware:** This compresses the response payload to reduce the amount of data transferred over the network, improving performance.
- **Cookie Policy**
- **MVC middleware:**
- **HTTPS Redirection Middleware:** This redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS to ensure that sensitive data is transmitted securely.
